# Build Reactive Websites with RxJS: Master Observables and Wrangle

Here I am following the RxJS course from [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/reactive-websites-rxjs/7XK3vg59jmr). The purpose of taking this course is to
understand reactive websites with RxJS and help me with my current position as a software developer. My team is responsible for an application that provides a streamlined
service to claim representatives to refer customers to a body-shops creating notes that automatically are saved to the claim file and the third party applications that handles appointments for body-shops. This application uses Angular 14 and heavily uses RxJS operators and NGRX to handle the application's state.

## RxJS:

RxJS is short for _Reactive eXtensions to JavaScript_

## Course Focus

This course focuses on:

* Asynchronous calls and control follow
* State management

## Asynchronous calls and control follow

JavaScript's async-first design has been both a blessing and a curse. While the event loop allows us to fire off AJAX calls with ease, keep track of them all can be quite the chore. A single AJAX request can be modeled as a promise, but more than one suddenly means there's a cacophony of items to manually track (and even cancel) as the user progresses through our app.

I will learn how to delegate both the calls and control flow to RXJS, allowing me to focus on the rest of my application.

## State management
