## Intro

Here we will look at some basic Rx concepts like variables, arrays, promises, and observables.

## Variables

Example of a **variable**:

```JS
let myVar = 42;
console.log(myVar);
```

As you probably know, a variable contains a single value, and that value can be used immediately after declaration. Variables are pretty simple. On the other had we have arrays.

## Array

Example of an **array**:

```JS
//Array represents a collection of values
let myArr = [42, 'Hello World', NaN];
console.log(myArr);
```
